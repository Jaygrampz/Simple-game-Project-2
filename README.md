# Collision game
* A template code was supplied by Hyperion Development. However, functions were added to enable the user to move his player all around the screen ie. Left, Right
Up, Down
* Three *enemy* objects were added which could appear anywhere on the screen once the game is started.
* One *prize* object was added which could appear anywhere once the game is started.

## Objective:
The objective of the game is that the user must avoid the enemy objects in order to get to the prize object. If the user collides into the enemy objects, they lose the game.
If the user collides into the prize object, they win
